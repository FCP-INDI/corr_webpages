Sample Description
------------------
The MRN Repeat Resting Sample consists of 112 scans from 56 healthy subjects. Each subject completed two scan sessions, four months apart. Two anatomical, resting fMRI, and DTI images are provided for each subject. Subjects were asked to keep their eyes open and presented with a fixation cross during the functional scan. They were given the following instructions: "We are about to begin the rest task. For this task you will be asked to lie still and keep your eyes focused on the crosshairs while the machine is on. Do you have any questions?"

Scan Parameters:

* Resting fMRI
* Anatomical
* DTI
