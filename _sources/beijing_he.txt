Sample Description
------------------
Data included in this sample are a subset of the Connectivity-based Brain Imaging Research Database (C-BIRD) at BNU. This sample contains data from 57 healthy young volunteers (male/female: 30/27; age: 19-30 years) who completed two MRI scan sessions within an interval of approximate 6-weeks (40.94Â±4.51 days). All participants were right-handed and had no history of neurological and psychiatric disorders. 

The first session included two resting-state fMRI scans, T1, T2 and DTI. The two resting-state fMRI scans were at the beginning and the end of the session (~20 minutes apart). The second scan session included resting-state fMRI, T1 and DTI. Participants were instructed to rest and relax with their eyes closed and not fall asleep.

Written informed consent was obtained from each participant, and this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning at Beijing Normal University.
