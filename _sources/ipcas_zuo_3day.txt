Sample Description
------------------
This sample includes 2 healthy young adults. Each participant was scanned five times a day over three days and each session contained three resting state scans.

Subjects were presented with a fixation cross and were instructed to keep their eyes open, fixate on the cross displayed on the screen, relax, and move as little as possible
