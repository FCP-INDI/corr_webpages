Sample Description
------------------
This data is part of the Neo-Spearman Project (NSP) at Beijing Normal University, and was originally used to evaluate the reliability of data acquired in NSP. It includes 62 healthy young adults (19-23 years old), who were scanned twice separated by at least three-months (103 days). Two modalities (T1/EPI) of brain images were acquired for all subjects. During scanning, subjects were presented with a blank screen and instructed to lie still, keep their eyes closed, relax and move as little as possible, also avoid any structured mental activity such as counting.

Scan Parameters:

* Resting fMRI (`Test <_static/scan_parameters/beijing_liu/beijing_liu_rest1.pdf>`_, `Retest <_static/scan_parameters/beijing_liu/beijing_liu_rest2.pdf>`_)
* Anatomical (`Test <_static/scan_parameters/beijing_he/beijing_he_anat1.pdf>`_, `Retest <_static/scan_parameters/beijing_he/beijing_he_anat1.pdf>`_)
