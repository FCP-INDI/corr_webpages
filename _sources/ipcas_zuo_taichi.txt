Sample Description
------------------
This sample includes 13 healthy older adults who served as the control group in a study on the effect of traditional Chinese Tai Chi Chun on brain structure and function, in a longitudinal experimental design. Each participant was scanned twice, with scans at least one year apart. Three modalities (T1/EPI/DTI) of brain images were acquired for each subject.

Subjects were presented with a blank screen and instructed to keep their eyes closed, relax and move as little as possible. Subjects were also asked not focus on their breathing or put themselves in a meditative state.

Scan Parameters:

* Resting fMRI
* Anatomical
* DTI
