Sample Description
------------------
This sample includes 72 typically developing children. Each participant was scanned twice within a session. Three modalities (T1 /T2/EPI) of brain images were acquired for all subjects. Subjects were presented with a fixation cross and were instructed to keep their eyes open, fixate on the cross displayed on the screen, relax, and move as little as possible
