Sample Description
------------------
This sample includes 24 healthy adults who served as the control group in a longitudinal study of brain structure and function during recovery from stroke. Each participant was scanned five times separated by 6 months. Three modalities (T1/EPI/DTI) of brain images were acquired for all subjects. During the resting scan, subjects were presented with a blank screen and instructed to keep their eyes closed, relax and move as little as possible.
