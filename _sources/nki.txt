Sample Description
------------------
Prior to launch of the `Enhanced NKI-Rockland Sample <http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/enhanced/>`_, an initial test-retest dataset was obtained to assess the reliability of multiband R-fMRI and DTI scans. The dataset is primarily composed of individuals from the initial NKI-RS - for these individuals psychiatric assessment information is available and included (participants were not excluded due to history of illness). For full information on subject demographics and the study protocol, please see the `NKI-RS webpage <http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/enhanced/>`_.
