Sample Description
------------------
This sample includes 35 typically developing children. Each participant underwent two scanning sessions one month apart. Three modalities (T1 /EPI/DTI) of brain images were acquired for all subjects. During scanning, subjects were instructed to keep their eyes closed, relax and move as little as possible.
