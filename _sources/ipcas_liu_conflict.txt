Sample Description
------------------
Two independent stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) experiments were conducted, both combining the Stroop task and the Simon task. There were two resting-state blocks in each experiment, one before the task blocks and the other after the task blocks. This sample includes 36 healthy young adults, 4 of which participated in both experiments. Each participant was scanned once for each experiment. Two modalities (T1/EPI) of brain images were acquired for all subjects. During functional scanning, subjects were presented with a fixation cross and instructed to keep their eyes open, stare at the fixation, relax and move as little as possible.
